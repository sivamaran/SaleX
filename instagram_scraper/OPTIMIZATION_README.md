# Instagram Scraper - Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented in the Instagram scraper to address the speed issues.

## üöÄ Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Async Concurrency with Worker Pool Pattern
- **Problem**: Sequential processing of URLs (one at a time)
- **Solution**: Implemented `asyncio.gather()` with worker pool pattern
- **Benefits**: 
  - Process multiple URLs concurrently
  - Configurable concurrency limits (default: 5 workers)
  - Better resource utilization

### 2. Browser Context Pooling
- **Problem**: Full browser lifecycle for each URL
- **Solution**: Pre-configured context pool (3-5 contexts)
- **Benefits**:
  - Reuse browser contexts across multiple URLs
  - Round-robin distribution to workers
  - Context lifecycle management (recycle after 20-30 operations)
  - Isolation: Each context maintains separate cookies/session state

### 3. Batch/Chunk Processing
- **Problem**: Launching too many scrapers at once causes blocking
- **Solution**: Group URLs into batches (5-10 concurrent scrapes)
- **Benefits**:
  - Wait for one batch to complete before starting the next
  - Prevents overwhelming Instagram's servers
  - Better rate limiting control

### 4. Browser Resource Optimization
- **Problem**: Inefficient browser resource usage
- **Solution**: 
  - Browser instance reuse across multiple URLs
  - Context pooling with pre-configured settings
  - Selective browser features (disable unnecessary features)
  - Headless mode optimization

### 5. Coordinated Rate Limiting
- **Problem**: Uncoordinated requests leading to blocking
- **Solution**: Global rate limiter shared across all workers
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents rate limit violations
  - Configurable delay between requests
  - Better anti-detection

### 6. Resource Management and Cleanup
- **Problem**: Memory leaks and resource accumulation
- **Solution**:
  - Regular cleanup of browser resources
  - Context usage tracking and recycling
  - Proper async resource management

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery Optimization
- **Problem**: Single URL failures blocking progress
- **Solution**:
  - Fail-fast strategy for problematic URLs
  - Graceful degradation - continue processing other URLs
  - Better error reporting and recovery

## üîß Configuration Options

### ScrapingConfig
```python
config = ScrapingConfig(
    max_workers=5,              # Max concurrent workers
    batch_size=8,               # URLs per batch
    context_pool_size=5,        # Browser contexts in pool
    context_reuse_limit=25,     # Operations before context recycle
    rate_limit_delay=1.0,       # Delay between requests (seconds)
    max_retries=2,              # Max retries per URL
    timeout_seconds=30,         # Request timeout
    cleanup_interval=10         # Cleanup interval
)
```

## üìä Performance Improvements

### Expected Speedup
- **2-5x faster** for small URL sets (4-8 URLs)
- **3-8x faster** for medium URL sets (10-20 URLs)
- **5-10x faster** for large URL sets (50+ URLs)

### Throughput Improvements
- **Original**: ~0.5-1 URLs/second
- **Optimized**: ~2-5 URLs/second (depending on configuration)

### Resource Efficiency
- **Memory**: Better memory management with context pooling
- **CPU**: Better CPU utilization with concurrent processing
- **Network**: Coordinated rate limiting prevents blocking

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from main_optimized import scrape_instagram_urls_optimized

urls = [
    "https://www.instagram.com/username1/",
    "https://www.instagram.com/p/post_id/",
    "https://www.instagram.com/reel/reel_id/"
]

result = await scrape_instagram_urls_optimized(urls)
```

### High-Performance Configuration
```python
from main_optimized import scrape_instagram_urls_optimized, ScrapingConfig

config = ScrapingConfig(
    max_workers=6,
    batch_size=10,
    context_pool_size=5,
    rate_limit_delay=0.5
)

result = await scrape_instagram_urls_optimized(urls, config=config)
```

### Class Usage
```python
from main_optimized import OptimizedInstagramScraper, ScrapingConfig

scraper = OptimizedInstagramScraper(
    headless=True,
    enable_anti_detection=True,
    config=ScrapingConfig(max_workers=4, batch_size=6)
)

result = await scraper.scrape(urls)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Performance Tests
```bash
cd instagram_scraper
python test_optimized.py
```

### Run Examples
```bash
cd instagram_scraper
python example_optimized.py
```

### Run Optimized Scraper
```bash
cd instagram_scraper
python main_optimized.py
```

## üìà Monitoring and Metrics

The optimized scraper provides detailed performance metrics:

```python
result = await scrape_instagram_urls_optimized(urls)
print(f"Throughput: {result['summary']['performance_metrics']['throughput_per_second']:.2f} URLs/second")
print(f"Total time: {result['summary']['total_time_seconds']:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Contexts used: {result['summary']['performance_metrics']['contexts_used']}")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- The optimized scraper includes built-in rate limiting
- Adjust `rate_limit_delay` based on your needs
- Start with conservative settings and increase gradually

### Resource Usage
- More concurrent workers = more memory usage
- Monitor system resources when scaling up
- Use `context_pool_size` to control memory usage

### Error Handling
- The scraper continues processing even if some URLs fail
- Check `result['errors']` for failed URLs
- Use `result['summary']['success_rate']` to monitor success rate

### Anti-Detection
- All anti-detection features are preserved
- Context pooling helps maintain session consistency
- Rate limiting reduces detection risk

## üîÑ Migration from Original

### Simple Migration
Replace:
```python
from main import scrape_instagram_urls
result = await scrape_instagram_urls(urls)
```

With:
```python
from main_optimized import scrape_instagram_urls_optimized
result = await scrape_instagram_urls_optimized(urls)
```

### Advanced Migration
For more control, use the class-based approach:
```python
from main_optimized import OptimizedInstagramScraper, ScrapingConfig

config = ScrapingConfig(max_workers=5, batch_size=8)
scraper = OptimizedInstagramScraper(config=config)
result = await scraper.scrape(urls)
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with default settings and scale up
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use the provided metrics to optimize
3. **Handle Errors**: Always check for errors in results
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and CPU usage
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respect Instagram's rate limits
6. **Testing**: Test with small batches before large-scale scraping

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Memory Issues**: Reduce `max_workers` and `context_pool_size`
2. **Rate Limiting**: Increase `rate_limit_delay`
3. **Context Errors**: Check browser installation and permissions
4. **Timeout Issues**: Increase `timeout_seconds` in config

### Debug Mode
Set `headless=False` to see browser windows and debug issues:
```python
result = await scrape_instagram_urls_optimized(urls, headless=False)
```
