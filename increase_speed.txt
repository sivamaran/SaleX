Currently, in  linkedin_scraper everything is processed sequentially: one browser, one extractor, one URL at a time. That’s why it feels slow.

1. Add Concurrency with asyncio
Right now in main.py, each URL is processed in a loop.
Instead, you can schedule multiple urls tasks concurrently with asyncio.gather.
Worker Pool Pattern: Implement a worker pool with configurable concurrency limits
Worker Management: Use asyncio.Semaphore to limit concurrent operations (start with 3-5 workers)
Coordinated Rate Limiting: Global Rate Limiter: Shared across all workers using asyncio primitive

2. Use Multiple Browser Contexts
Context Pool Size: 3-5 pre-configured contexts (matches worker count)
Context Assignment: Round-robin distribution to workers
Context Lifecycle: Reuse contexts for multiple URLs, recycle after 20-30 operations
Isolation: Each context maintains separate cookies/session state

3. Browser Resource Optimization
Current Issue: Full browser lifecycle for each URL
Solutions:
Browser Instance Reuse: Keep browser instances alive across multiple URLs
Context Pooling: Maintain a pool of pre-configured browser contexts
Selective Browser Features: Disable unnecessary features (images, CSS, fonts) for faster loading
Headless Mode Optimization: Ensure consistent headless operation for speed

4. Batch / Chunk Processing
Instead of launching 50 scrapers at once (which will get you blocked fast), group URLs into batches (say 5–10 concurrent scrapes).
Wait for one batch to complete, then start the next.

5. Memory and Resource Management
Resource Cleanup Scheduling: Regular cleanup of browser resources

6. Error Handling and Recovery Optimization
Current Issue: Single URL failures may block progress
Solutions:
Fail-Fast Strategy: Quickly identify and skip problematic URLs
Graceful Degradation: Continue processing other URLs even if some fail
