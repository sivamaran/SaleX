   - Queries are executed against search engines/platforms
   - URLs are collected and classified by source type
   - URLs are stored in MongoDB for processing

3. **Scraping Phase**:
   - URLs are distributed to appropriate scrapers
   - Each scraper processes its assigned URLs
   - Extracted data is normalized and stored

4. **Processing Phase**:
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Lead scoring and qualification
   - Contact information extraction
   - Duplicate detection and merging

5. **Output Phase**:
   - Qualified leads are stored in the database
   - Results are made available via API
   - Notifications are sent upon completion

   - HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
   - AI-powered content analysis for complex pages

4. **Post-Processing**:
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Entity disambiguation
   - Quality scoring and validation

### Why a Universal Web Scraper Wasn't Enough

While the web_scraper is powerful, several factors necessitated the development of platform-specific scrapers:

1. **Platform-Specific Challenges**:
   - Social media platforms implement aggressive anti-scraping measures
   - Each platform has unique authentication requirements
   - Data structures and APIs vary significantly between platforms

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Dedicated scrapers can be optimized for specific platforms
   - Platform-specific rate limiting and request patterns
   - Caching strategies that work well for one platform might not for another

3. **Data Quality**:
   - Specialized parsers for platform-specific data formats
   - Better handling of platform-specific content structures
   - More accurate extraction of platform-specific metadata

### Strengths of the Current Approach

1. **Modularity**:
   - Clear separation between generic and platform-specific scraping logic
   - Easy to add new scrapers for additional platforms
   - Components can be tested and updated independently

2. **Resilience**:
   - Failure in one scraper doesn't affect others
   - Platform-specific error handling and recovery
   - Graceful degradation when features aren't available

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Smaller, focused codebases for each platform
   - Easier to update when platforms change their interfaces
   - Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries

### Limitations and Challenges

1. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Multiple codebases to maintain
   - Need to keep up with changes across all platforms
   - Inconsistent feature implementation across scrapers

2. **Resource Usage**:
   - Each scraper may require its own browser instance
   - Memory and CPU overhead from multiple processes
   - Complex deployment requirements

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Different scrapers might extract slightly different data
   - Normalization challenges across platforms
   - Varying levels of data quality and completeness

## Scraper Architecture

### Why Multiple Scrapers?

The system uses specialized scrapers for different platforms due to several key reasons:

1. **Platform-Specific APIs**:
   - Each social media platform has its own API with unique endpoints and authentication mechanisms
   - Response formats and data structures vary significantly between platforms
   - Rate limiting and request throttling are implemented differently

2. **Anti-Bot Measures**:
   - Platforms implement sophisticated bot detection
   - Each requires specific handling of:
     - Request headers and cookies
     - JavaScript rendering
     - CAPTCHAs and other challenges
     - Behavioral patterns to avoid detection

3. **Data Structure Variations**:
   - Different platforms expose different data points
   - Data normalization is required to create a unified lead format
   - Some platforms require multiple API calls to gather complete information

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Specialized scrapers can be optimized for specific platforms
   - Parallel processing and batching can be tuned per platform
   - Caching strategies can be customized based on data volatility

### Scraper Implementation Details

Each scraper follows a common pattern:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Load configuration
   - Initialize browser instances
   - Authenticate if required

2. **URL Processing**:
